Calculates Net Working Capital for a company

What is net working capital? 

It is a balance sheet measure.
In short, it is the difference between current assets (inventory + accounts receivable) and current assets (accounts payable).

This calculator calculates the raw value of the variables and returns the set growth percentages to the user.


This calculator is my first python project ever in GIT.
