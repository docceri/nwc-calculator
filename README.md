Calculates the Net Working Capital for a company

What is net working capital? 

It is used to measure the short-term liquidity of a business and give a general expression how the effectively the company uses assets.
In short, it is the difference between current assets (inventory + accounts receivable) and current liabilities (accounts payable).

This calculator takes the raw value of the variables and growth percentages, and then returns the forecasted NWC to user.


This calculator is my first python project ever in GIT.
